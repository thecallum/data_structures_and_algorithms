### Example - An algorithm for making tea

1. Boil water
2. Add the tea bag to the cup
3. Pour the boiling water into the cup
4. Remove the tea bag when the tea is ready
5. Add the desired amount of milk to the cup
6. Add the desired amount of sugar to the cup
7. Stir the contents of the cup with a spoon
