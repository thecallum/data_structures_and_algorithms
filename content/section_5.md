# Section 5 - Stacks

## What is a Stack?

- Abstract data type
- LIFO - Last In, First Out (eg. add to the top of card deck, remove from the top of card deck)
- Ideal data structure - Linked List
- `O(1)` constant complexity when backed by a linked list
- `O(n)` linear complexity when backed by an array list

### Methods

- Push - Add item to the top of the stack
- Pop - Remove the top item from the stack
- Peek - View the top item without removing it
